  abstract =	 {Inferring parameters for models of biological
                  processes is a current challenge in systems biology,
                  as is the related problem of comparing competing
                  models that explain the data. In this work we apply
                  Skilling's nested sampling to address both of these
                  problems. Nested sampling is a Bayesian method for
                  exploring parameter space that transforms a
                  multi-dimensional integral to a 1D integration over
                  likelihood space. This approach focusses on the
                  computation of the marginal likelihood or
                  evidence. The ratio of evidences of different models
                  leads to the Bayes factor, which can be used for
                  model comparison. We demonstrate how nested sampling
                  can be used to reverse-engineer a system's behaviour
                  whilst accounting for the uncertainty in the
                  results. The effect of missing initial conditions of
                  the variables as well as unknown parameters is
                  investigated. We show how the evidence and the model
                  ranking can change as a function of the available
                  data. Furthermore, the addition of data from extra
                  variables of the system can deliver more information
                  for model comparison than increasing the data from
                  one variable, thus providing a basis for
                  experimental design.},
